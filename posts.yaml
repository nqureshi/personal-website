  content: ! "Apparently the [All Souls exam](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Souls_College,_Oxford#Examination_Fellowships)
    is the hardest in the world. Whether that's true or not, the [questions](http://www.all-souls.ox.ac.uk/userfiles/file/EF/PastPapers/General.pdf)
    are interesting and answering them is a good mental challenge. In this series
    I intend to do that - without looking at anything external.\n\nThe first question
    is taken from the paper Philosophy I, [here](http://www.all-souls.ox.ac.uk/userfiles/file/EF/PastPapers/Philosophy.pdf).\n\nLet
    me begin by describing two <i>opposed</i> answers to this question, based on intuition.
    I will then combine these intuitions into a view which honours the right in both,
    while avoiding any confusions.\n\nSuppose, at time <i>t</i>, there is a box and
    it contains, with probability 0.5, a marble.\n\nIntuition 1: Objectively, measuring
    the state of the world at <i>t</i>, the marble is under Box 1. <i>Before</i> opening
    any boxes, I conclude that the marble lies under Box 1 with probability 0.5. <i>After</i>
    opening box one, however, I conclude that the marble lies under Box 1 with probability
    1.\n\nNothing about the world has changed except that I have observed something.
    The probability has changed because of this observation. But an objective thing
    is something about which my observations and subjective state of knowledge cannot
    possibly make any difference. <i>Therefore, there cannot be any such thing as
    an objective probability.</i>\n\nIntuition 2: At time <i>t</i>, if it is true
    that the probability of the marble being under a given box is 0.5, then if I guessed
    randomly, I would be correct one out of two times on average.\n\nThis simple observation
    gives me objective, usable knowledge about the world. Consider a game in which
    there are 100 boxes, each with 0.5 probability of containing a marble. I have
    to guess how many of these boxes actually contain a marble – call my guess N.
    I guess, then I lose £\\|(N-X)\\|. \n\nIn this game, my <i>dominant strategy</i>
    – i.e. the strategy which minimizes \\|N-X\\|, my loss – is to guess ‘50’ every
    time. This is an empirically demonstrable result – someone who disbelieves this
    is welcome to play the game and guess ‘1’ or ‘2’ instead of ‘50’ and observe the
    outcome. If an intelligent alien changed my brain such that I mistakenly believed
    that the probability was, e.g., 0.01, then that would not make the probability
    0.01. The fact that the probability is 0.5 is completely independent of whether
    or not any particular mind believes that it is 0.5. But this is the definition
    of an objective truth. <i>Therefore, probability must be objective.</i>\n\nHow
    to resolve this paradox?\n\nWe have proven, informally, that:\n\n* Probability
    is mind-independent, i.e. probabilities do not depend on someone believing in
    them to be true (objective)\n* Estimated probabilities can change based on the
    state of knowledge of the observer (subjective)\n\nObjective things are <i>mind-independent</i>.
    A rock does not depend on someones observing that rock; it exists whether or not
    someone is there to observe it. Moreover, if a rock is an igneous rock, then it
    is an igneous rock regardless, once again, of whether someone is there to observe
    it.\n\nHowever: my estimation that the rock is igneous, depends on my state of
    knowledge about the world; or, in Bayesian terms, my [prior](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prior_probability).
    The probability estimate can change as I discover new facts, e.g. that the rock
    has a glassy texture or displays layering. Moreover, the fact that I believe that
    the probability is X, is not a fact about the world, it is a fact about my mind.\n\nDoes
    that mean that anything goes? Obviously not. The probability of a fair coin landing
    heads is 0.5. Provided that I know all the facts, <i>I cannot change this probability
    by changing my beliefs</i>. If I could, then we would witness people winning the
    lottery, or poker, at will. Clearly, this is not the case.\n\nTo sum up: probabilities
    are (a) true or false, (b) regardless of what I believe about this probabilities.
    Estimated probabilities (c) depend on the prior knowledge of the mind in question.
    Moreover, (d) the fact that the probability is X is a fact about my mind.\n\n<b>Based
    on these facts, it is wrong to conclude either that probability is subjective
    <i>or</i> that probability is objective</b>. For example, traits a and b are features
    of things we call objective, but traits c and d are features of things that we
    call subjective.\n\nWe know all the facts. Telling us that it is subjective or
    objective gives us <i>no additional information</i>, nor does it lead to any differing
    expectations about reality. (Like the old question: if a tree falls in the woods,
    does it make a sound? It depends on whether your definition of sound includes
    'someone hearing it', or whether it's just 'acoustic vibrations'. That's it. There's
    no factual disagreement here, it's all at the level of <i>language</i> rather
    than <i>the world</i>.)\n\nProbability has conceptual features from both classes,
    so some composite label would be best, if a label were necessary. As it is, <b>neither
    'subjective' nor 'objective' will do</b>."

  content: ! "My favourite thing about Peter Thiel's <i>invaluable</i> lectures (via
    [BlakeMasters](http://blakemasters.tumblr.com/)), was Thiel's question: \"What
    do you believe that almost no one else believes?\" (The business version: \"What
    valuable company is no one building right now?\")\n\nWhat's elegant about this
    is that the logic for business mirrors the logic for beliefs.\n\nThe business
    logic is basically the efficient market hypothesis. Think of the set of all money-making
    ideas, and assume that you have a market full of entrepreneurs who want to make
    money. All of the <i>obvious</i> valuable ideas are grabbed and those markets
    become saturated. Only <i>non-obvious</i> ideas remain, and many of those are
    grabbed, too.\n\nThe bar of difficulty is high: most things have been taken already.
    Only the ideas that lie in unexpected directions are left, and most people don't
    take those directions, because they don't look like they could work to the average
    mind. \n\nThink of it as a treasure hunt, where all the areas of the map that
    are:\n\n1.  Obviously promising for treasure\n2.  Not dangerous \n\nare exhausted.
    The only areas that remain are the ones that either seem <i>non-promising</i>,
    or <i>dangerous</i>. The business versions of these obstacles are: \"that will
    never work, what a crazy idea\", and \"that's way too difficult, you'll never
    manage that without getting eaten\" respectively.\n\nAnd yet, <i>some opportunities
    will always exist</i>. The map is never exhausted. \n\nYou just have to be either
    fearless (to get over the danger) or unconventional (to go to the areas that seem
    unpromising).\n\nA nice illustration of the 'non-promising' argument is from Paul
    Buchheit inventing AdSense on his [blog](http://paulbuchheit.blogspot.co.uk/2009/01/communicating-with-code.html).
    It fits the pattern: people thought it was an obviously bad idea and, in any case,
    probably too hard.\n\n> The great thing about this process was that I didn't need
    to sell anyone on my ideas. I would just write the code, release the feature,
    and watch the response. Usually, everyone (including me) would end up hating whatever
    it was (especially my ideas), but we always learned something from the experience,
    and we were able to quickly move on to other ideas. \n\n> The most dramatic example
    of this process was the creation of content targeted ads (now known as \"AdSense\",
    or maybe \"AdSense for Content\"). The idea of targeting our keyword based ads
    to arbitrary content on the web had been floating around the company for a long
    time -- it was \"obvious\". However, it was also \"obviously bad\". Most people
    believed that it would require some kind of fancy artificial intelligence to understand
    the content well enough to target ads, and even if we had that, nobody would click
    on the ads. I thought they were probably right.\n\n> However, we needed a way
    for Gmail to make money, and Sanjeev Singh kept talking about using relevant ads,
    even though it was obviously a \"bad idea\". I remained skeptical, but thought
    that it might be a fun experiment, so I connected to that ads database (I assure
    you, random engineers can no longer do this!), copied out all of the ads+keywords,
    and did a little bit of sorting and filtering with some unix shell commands. I
    then hacked up the \"adult content\" classifier that Matt Cutts and I had written
    for safe-search, linked that into the Gmail prototype, and then loaded the ads
    data into the classifier. My change to the classifier (which completely broke
    its original functionality, but this was a separate code branch) changed it from
    classifying pages as \"adult\", to classifying them according to which ad was
    most relevant. The resulting ad was then displayed in a little box on our Gmail
    prototype ui. The code was rather ugly and hackish, but more importantly, it only
    took a few hours to write! \n\n> I then released the feature on our unsuspecting
    userbase of about 100 Googlers, and then went home and went to sleep. The response
    when I returned the next day was not what I would classify as \"positive\". Someone
    may have used the word \"blasphemous\". I liked the ads though -- they were amusing
    and often relevant. An email from someone looking for their lost sunglasses got
    an ad for new sunglasses. The lunch menu had an ad for balsamic vinegar.\n\nOf
    course, AdSense is now worth 28% of Google's revenue, or almost $10 billion. Some
    bad idea.\n\nFinding ideas in areas that don't seem promising seems pretty hard.
    One trick is to ask the question: will things still be that way in 100 years?
    If not, how should they change?\n\nI learned this trick from [Paul Graham](http://paulgraham.com/ambitious.html).\n\nGoogle
    may seem like it will exist forever, but are you really telling me that people
    will still be using Google for search in 100 years? Probably not. If that's the
    case, then something will displace Google - sooner or later. Why not now?\n\nI
    said at the start of this post that the business logic mirrors the idea logic.
    What about ideas?\n\nWell, think of a set of beliefs. Actually, think of the <i>set
    of all sets</i> of beliefs, i.e. a load of 'belief-packages'. What era you are
    born in, and where, determines where you land in this set. (Being born in ancient
    Greece means that I most likely have a very different set of beliefs to someone
    born in the UK today.)\n\nWe know that every era in the past had belief-sets that
    had mixed proportions of true/false factual beliefs, or right/wrong moral beliefs.
    No society thus far has had fully-true-on-average belief-sets, or fully 'right'
    belief-sets. It is improbable that our society has got there. So there must be
    some factual beliefs that we hold that are untrue, or moral beliefs that are wrong.
    \n\nIt's worth thinking about what those are. After all, at some point in the
    future some guy is going to disrupt some of our most preciously held beliefs that
    we currently consider true or right. Which ones do we think those will be?"

  content: ! "A few interesting experimental results:\n\n* People display stronger
    preferences for eating an apple over a candy bar <i>if this takes place in a week's
    time, compared to today</i>;\n* People tend to explain their own actions <i>situationally</i>,
    and others' actions by <i>dispositions</i>. <i>He</i> tripped over a rock because
    he's careless, <i>I</i> tripped over a rock because it was placed really stupidly;
    <i>she</i>'s a conservative because she's from a rich background, <i>I'm</i> a
    liberal because of arguments xyz - and so on)\n* Employees are less likely to
    see the same policy as desirable if it's going to be implemented <i>tomorrow</i>,
    as opposed to the distant future;\n* People negotiate better if the outcome of
    the negotiation isn't going to take effect for several months, compared to if
    it will take effect tomorrow.\nMost people associate living in a cottage with
    peace, quiet and sunshine. But in practice, living in a cottage could also mean
    bad plumbing, mosquitos, no medical care, dampness and so on. \n\nWhen we're taking
    a decision to live in a cottage _next year_ as opposed to living in a cottage
    <i>tomorrow</i>, we are more likely to think of the peace and quiet. If it's going
    to be <i>tomorrow</i>, though, we're more likely to think about transport, weather
    and other such practicalities.\n\nThese are all examples of near-far bias, or
    , as the psychologists call it, 'construal level theory'. \n\nThe idea is that
    humans process things that are 'near' differently from things that are further
    away. The farther away an experience is in time, for example, the more abstractly
    we tend to think of it. Whereas the nearer something is in time, the more concrete
    and local our reasoning is. The same goes for 'nearness' in space.\n\nIt's a powerful
    idea. [Correspondence bias](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_attribution_error),
    for example, becomes a special case: my beliefs are 'near' (I see them in great
    detail), whereas someone else's beliefs are 'far'. I explain my beliefs by detailed
    context, argumentation and reasoning, whereas someone else's beliefs are seen
    as instances of cruder, higher-level traits such as social background, 'conservatism'
    and so on. \n\nThis heuristic can be manipulated for signalling purposes. \n\nWhy
    should smoking be 'artistic'? Why do religions sometimes mandate growing beards?
    \n\nThe ideals most major religions profess are similar, but the behaviours each
    encourage can sometimes seem arbitrary, e.g not eating with your left hand, resting
    on the 7th day, and so forth. \n\nIf the ideals you profess contradict the actions
    you actually prefer, you run into potential accusations of hypocrisy, because
    people judge by actions. For example, if you claim to be religious and a follower
    of Jesus, who professed peace, but you are actually a driving force behind a war
    that Jesus would certainly not have advocated, it seems clear that that the 'near'
    you contradicts the 'far' you. What's a hypocrite to do?\n\n<i>The ideal strategy
    for our hypocrite to follow would be to have 'near' actions that are consistent
    with, and associated with, the 'far' ideals she wishes to signal, but which do
    not substantively affect the 'near' actions that she really prefers.</i>\n\nNote
    that these behaviours are <i>consistent with</i> the ideals that these religions
    share, but are clearly not logically implied by them. Could the behaviours have
    evolved to signal those ideals? They can therefore be gamed by people who want
    to signal those ideals, but do not actually want to adopt the behavioural pattern
    that the ideals would really imply: i.e. hypocrites. \n\nIdeals are 'far', i.e.
    abstract. Actions, on the other hand, are concrete and therefore 'near'.)\n\nI've
    noticed that the really great religious leaders I've met have usually been very
    funny, happy people. Whereas the foot soldiers are, more often than not, solemn
    and not much fun. There's nothing in the scriptures to say that you <i>have</i>
    to be that way, so it's probably signalling behaviour. Which explains why the
    leaders don't have to do it - because they know the essence of their religion.\n\nThis
    would also explain why so many wannabe writers are pretentious, wear large glasses,
    and so on, whereas real writers don't necessarily display that behaviour in any
    correlated way. The wannabes need to signal their writer-status, and, moreover,
    are more likely not to really want to be writers so much as they want to be perceived
    as writers. Whereas the good writers prefer writing, as evidenced by the fact
    that we consider them good writers. \n\nSo if you want to be a good writer, leave
    the beret in the closet and just write. Anything else and you're fooling yourself."

  content: ! "> “I suspect that when the history of the 21st century is written circa
    2100, he [Girard] will be seen as one of the great intellectuals” - Peter Thiel\n\nWhen
    Blake Masters was posting his great notes on [Peter Thiel's lectures at Stanford](http://blakemasters.tumblr.com/peter-thiels-cs183-startup),
    I found myself fascinated by the influence of [Rene Girard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rene_Girard).\n\nGirard's
    an original thinker. I'm not fully persuaded by his worldview: it explains a lot,
    but not everything. I've summarized his views here.\n\n1\\. <b>Mimesis determines
    what you want</b>: In Girard's view, people have <i>appetites</i>, which are your
    basic evolutionary needs: e.g. hunger; and <i>desires</i>, which are all other
    wants, e.g. the desire for a diamond ring. <b>Girard's belief is that people form
    desires based on what others around them want</b>. \n\nThis is known as the 'mimetic
    mechanism'. People take their cues from the people around them. They use other
    people as 'models', and (subconsciously) want what other people want, while rationalizing
    the whole time. In the diamond ring example, companies like [DeBeers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Beers)
    create a want artificially, and it catches on like a virus. People want diamond
    rings because other people want them, but they rationalise it by saying \"<i>it
    shows that my partner loves me</i>\".\n\nHow has this influenced Thiel? In [this
    video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=esk7W9Jowtc), Thiel
    notes that people can be \"disturbingly herdlike\". Both this assertion, & Thiel's
    general contrarianism, chime with Girard's philosophy. More generally:\n\n* <b>Stock
    market</b>: The average agent is <b>not</b> a rational utility-maximizer who coldly
    assess the fundamentals before making investments. Rather, the stock market is
    fundamentally herd driven. Therefore, there are opportunities to be exploited:
    people form blind spots because they are collectively taking their cues from each
    other. One example here is Thiel [calling the $8 billion housing bubble](http://bigthink.com/ideas/17721)
    before most other people, making his fund a lot of money as a result. \n* <b>Education</b>:
    Most people still believe that getting an education guarantees safety. Thiel believes
    that the decision to invest so much in higher education is irrational. If education
    is overvalued, there are opportunities to be exploited. Hence the ['20 under 20'](http://www.thielfellowship.org/)
    scheme. \n* <b>Business/technology</b>: Thiel tends to look for startups doing
    fundamentally new or different things, rather than copying existing ideas. The
    Girardian view implies that people will over-crowd certain areas (e.g. social
    web applications) and under-crowd other areas (e.g. life-extension tech). Thiel
    seems to agree (from [Founder's Fund](http://www.foundersfund.com/)): \"VC has
    ceased to be the funder of the future, and instead has become a funder of features,
    widgets, irrelevances.\"\n\n2\\. <b>Mimesis as the cause of conflict</b>: Girard's
    view is that conflict caused by the mimetic mechanism: people fight because they
    model their desires on each other, come to desire similar things, and end up fighting
    over them. Because of this imitiative process, they tend to become more and more
    alike. Think of Microsoft/Apple/Google all trying to make the best smartphone/tablet.\n\n>
    “Violence is generated by this process; or rather, violence is the process itself
    when two or more partners try to prevent one another from appropriating the object
    they all desire through physical or other means” (Girard).\n\nThiel clearly subscribes
    to this view. From Blake Masters's transcripts of his lectures:\n\n> So which
    perspective is right in the tech world? How much is Marx? How much is Shakespeare?\n\n>
    In the great majority of cases, it’s straight Shakespeare. They grind each other
    down through increased competition. And everyone loses sight of the bigger picture.\n\n(Source:
    [Blake Masters](http://blakemasters.tumblr.com/post/23250566538/peter-thiels-cs183-startup-class-12-notes-essay))\n\n*
    <b>Business / tech</b>:, Thiel believes that a myopic focus on your competitors
    can be dangerous if it compromises your own vision. In the lecture quoted above,
    he uses Google/Microsoft as \tan example, noting how e.g. Microsoft's decision
    to go after Google in search has cost them billions of dollars. The counterargument
    here (made by Reid Hoffman in the lecture) is that Microsoft is rationally going
    after a lucrative part of the internet. Thiel, however, disagrees: \n\n> \"It
    isn’t just rational calculation because tremendous effort is spent on things that,
    probabilistically, aren’t lucrative at all.\"\n\n* <b>Hiring/business</b>: Probably
    the source of Thiel's 'extreme focus' philosophy (source: [Quora](http://www.quora.com/PayPal/What-strong-beliefs-on-culture-for-entrepreneurialism-did-Peter-Max-David-have-at-PayPal/answer/Keith-Rabois)).
    This is the idea that each person, in an organization, is given one thing to focus
    on and therefore one contribution that they will primarily be judged by. The rationale
    makes sense from a Girardian point of view: if you give people more than one thing,
    the probability of overlap increases; increase the overlap, and you end up with
    people wanting the same thing and therefore conflict, something Thiel takes pains
    to avoid within a company. (\"Most companies are killed by internal infighting,
    even though it may not seem like it.\")\n\n3\\. <b>The scapegoat mechanism</b>:
    Girard's theory of social change: societies gradually become more and more conflicted
    as mimesis spreads like a virus & people start fighting over the same things.
    A crisis point is reached. This crisis is resolved by the scapegoat mechanism:
    people decide that one person (or group of people) is responsible for the social
    discord and persecute / kill that person. The cycle then repeats. \n\nThiel subscribes
    to this view, as is evident from [his lecture on the founder as god](http://blakemasters.tumblr.com/post/24578683805/peter-thiels-cs183-startup-class-18-notes-essay).
    You can see, from the lecture, that it affects his views on the justice system
    (where the jury isn't rational, you often get perverse outcomes because of the
    scapegoat mechanism), society (celebrities rise, are crowned as kings, & then
    people turn on them), politics (right wing / left wing polarization, resulting
    in each side having their own scapegoats; the Occupy movement scapegoating the
    rich). \n\n4\\. <b>Religion</b>: Girard is a Christian. One of his arguments in
    this area is that Christianity is a unique religion that represents a turning
    point in human history. \n\nWhy? Throughout most of human history, society has
    been sacrificing essentially random people (scapegoats) to restore social order.
    <i>Christanity is the first religion to call humans out on this monstrous behaviour</i>,
    by showing us very clearly that the person being scapegoated is totally innocent
    - by definition, since he's the son of God. \n\nThe scapegoat mechanism stops
    working if everyone knows about it. In the absence of the ability to resort to
    the scapegoat mechanism, society could potentially get more and more conflictual,
    without having a clear way of resolving conflicts. (This view probably contradicts
    [the empirical evidence](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111904106704576583203589408180.html).)\n\nThiel
    is, from what I have read, Christian as well. No public statements go into detail
    on his religious belief, so I can't make claims about it: however, it's probable
    that Girard's view of Christianity was a key influence. He certainly believes
    that increasing conflict ('bad mimesis') is a possible and not unlikely outcome."

  content: ! 'I saw ''Moneyball'' recently. It''s about a baseball coach who takes
    on a failing team and turns them into a huge success. His method? Acquire players
    who seem terrible, but are actually good. In other words, find undervalued baseball
    players.


    This got me thinking about books. I''ve read some great books recently which I
    wouldn''t have heard of by reading ''best of'' lists or going through an A-Z of
    the classics. In almost all cases, I heard of them through bloggers or forums.
    Yet I consider these to be some of the most important books I''ve read so far.


    These books don''t look like they''ll be worth much on the surface, and turn out
    to be really great. They''re undervalued.


    I''m not necessarily talking about obscure books/authors here. I''m talking about
    the ratio of how good the book is to how good you expect it to be. These are the
    outliers, the ones that most people don''t talk about very much or haven''t heard
    of, and yet turn out to be profoundly brilliant.


    One interesting pattern these books display - with the caveat that this is a very
    small sample size - is that they''re generally in a particular niche. ''Impro'',
    for example, is disguised as a drama book but turns out to be a book about education
    philosophy, creativity, the theory of narrative and the role of status in human
    interaction; ''The Inner Game of Tennis'' looks like a tennis instruction manual
    and turns out to be a book about Zen, the ''two selves'', and other things.


    I''d love to find more of these. So if you know of any, please email me, Facebook
    me, tweet me, whatever.


    The list so far:


    1\. ''**[Impro](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Impro-Performance-Books-Improvisation-Theatre/dp/0713687010/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1350209370&amp;sr=8-1)**''
    by Keith Johnstone. Learning certain sets of concepts - like Newtonian mechanics,
    calculus, comparative advantage - changes the way you see the world. ''Impro''
    gave me at least a piece of the set of concepts for understanding human interaction
    at a conscious, theoretical level. Yet it''s a totally unpretentious book about
    improvisational drama.


    This is probably the book I''d recommend the most from this list to the average
    person.


    2\. ''**[The Inner Game of Tennis](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Inner-Game-Tennis-Timothy-Gallwey/dp/0330295136/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1350209411&amp;sr=1-1)**''
    by Timothy Gallwey. This is supposed to be a book about getting better at tennis,
    but only one chapter is devoted to the actual mechanics of tennis. Instead, it''s
    a great instruction manual on emotion, stress, Zen Buddhism, and achievement.
    Frankly, it blew my mind.


    You can get a taste it it in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50L44hEtVos)
    brilliant video with Alan Kay, but it''s only a fraction of the kind of thing
    you''ll find in this book.


    3\. ''**[The Philosophical Investigations](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Philosophical-Investigations-Ludwig-Wittgenstein/dp/1405159294/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1350209483&amp;sr=1-1)**''
    by Ludwig Wittgenstein. This is probably the book with the most ''classic'' status
    of the bunch. I find that it''s thoroughly undervalued by philosophers, though,
    who see it as an arcane and eccentric work of little value. And ordinary people
    don''t bother reading it, probably for good reason: it''s a difficult thing to
    read. However, spending the time to understand it is hugely rewarding.


    Ironically for a book ignored by most philosophers, it contains the answers to
    a lot of their questions, and the method for answering all of them.


    4\. ''**[Raise High The Roofbeams, Carpenter / Seymour: An Introduction](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Raise-High-Roof-Carpenters-Seymour/dp/0241950465/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1350209566&amp;sr=1-1)**''
    by J.D. Salinger. I was tempted to put ''Franny and Zooey'' here too, but I think
    it has enough devotion that it''s disqualified. This collection of two stories
    by Salinger, however, is much less well known. Yet I''d put this in my fiction
    top 5. I must have read Seymour: An Introduction about 20 times.


    I''ve recommended this to a few people and only one other person has liked it
    as much as I do. Most people didn''t get it. I''m not sure what conclusion to
    draw from that.


    5\. ''**[Shakespeare''s Sonnets](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Shakespeares-Sonnets-Yale-Nota-Bene/dp/0300085060/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1350209598&amp;sr=1-1)**''
    by Stephen Booth. If you don''t get poetry, read Stephen Booth. Maybe you''ve
    read some poems and really like them, but you can''t articulate exactly why beyond
    just gesturing. Booth gives a definition of why poems are good that is, I think,
    objective enough that you could develop a computer-generated index of the goodness
    of a poem out of it. Not everyone will agree with it, but I''ve found it works
    really well. Wikipedia has a good list of some of his stuff online [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Booth_(academic)).


    6\. ''**[Principles](http://www.bwater.com/Uploads/FileManager/Principles/Bridgewater-Associates-Ray-Dalio-Principles.pdf)''&nbsp;**(pdf)
    by Ray Dalio. Dalio''s a hedge fund manager - the most successful one in the world.
    His firm, Bridgewater, is known for being radically transparent: every meeting
    is recorded and recordings are available to anyone (so I could access the recordings
    of a meeting between two managers discussing my feedback, for example).


    This is good reading if you''re in business and want to understand what makes
    a good company culture, and how to solve problems. It''s also good reading in
    general, because Dalio has a relentlessly rational, critical take on things and
    it''s good for people to see that kind of mind at work. He talks a lot about how
    to achieve things as well, which is always useful. His advice here is better than
    any self-help book.&nbsp;


    7\. ''**[Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain](http://www.amazon.co.uk/New-Drawing-Right-Side-Brain/dp/0007116454
    "Drawing")**'' by Betty Edwards. Again, this blew my mind. I sucked at drawing
    as a teenager, and this book taught me how to do it. She specializes in teaching
    people to draw competently over short periods of time using what I can only describe
    as extremely clever hacks.&nbsp;


    In the process, the book also taught me that (a) with hard work and the right
    methods, you can learn most things, and your barriers are probably mental; (b)
    &lsquo;bad&rsquo; drawers don&rsquo;t look at the thing itself and draw its shape,
    they translate reality into abstract concepts first and then draw what that concept
    visually looks like, and a great way to prove this (and hack the process) is to
    copy a drawing upside down; (c) seeing things as they really are is harder than
    you think.&nbsp;


    8\. **[Ray Carney](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Carney)**: not naming a particular
    book here. Like the other books here, his writings seem to be just about films,
    but if you read them deeply enough they turn out to be a recipe for more than
    that - in this case, how to be a good, empathetic human being. He got me into
    John Cassavetes, which alone makes him worth the read. His writings on film are
    amazing. You can find a bunch of them via Wikipedia.&nbsp;


    I actually don''t expect most people to like the books on this list - that''s
    just a sober prediction. To me, though, that''s a good sign. If everything I liked
    was what everybody *would* like, then I''d have something to worry about.&nbsp;'

    informs us that: \n\n><i>he could not successfully \nwork his way through the
    institution of high school</i> \n\nand that: \n\n>he has not \nbeen a regular
    presence around his mother’s house for years.\n\nJeffrey \nToobin, of the New
    Yorker, [writes that](http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/comment/2013/06/edward-snowden-nsa-leaker-is-no-hero.html)
    Snowden is: \n\n>a grandiose \nnarcissist who deserves to be in prison.\n\nIn
    a really [marvelous piece](http://www.politico.com/story/2013/06/10-things-to-know-about-edward-snowden-92491.html?hp=r2)
    called '10 Things to Know About Edward Snowden', Politico decided that the most
    important thing you need know is that \"<i>He doesn't have a high school diploma</i>\".
    No. 3 is \"<i>He wasn't a friendly neighbour</i>\".\n\nThese smears would be laughable,
    if they weren't sad. When people have nothing intelligent to say, they resort
    to name-calling and ad \nhominem attacks. Snowden's relationship with his mother
    has nothing to do with, well, anything.\n\nThis isn't new. Whenever revelations
    like these appear, the media launches a coordinated effort to smear the character
    of the revealer. \n \nBack in the 70s, a guy named Daniel Ellsberg leaked the
    Pentagon Papers, which \nshowed that the government had lied about Vietnam & dragged
    the US into a war \nthat it knew:\n\n- It couldn't win\n\n- Would kill many more
    people than \nthey said it would\n\nAfter the leak, the government went into full
    attack mode. They even [broke into the office of Ellsberg's psychiatrist](http://www.historycommons.org/timeline.jsp?nixon_and_watergate_tmln_pentagon_papers=nixon_and_watergate_tmln_ellsberg_break_in&timeline=nixon_and_watergate_tmln).
    They investigated dozens of his family, friends, & colleagues, to find anything
    damaging, that could distract from what he was saying. \n\nAnother whistleblower,
    Julian Assange, received even more brutal treatment. Here's [another hit piece
    on him](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/24/world/24assange.html?hp), again run
    by the NYT, filled with subtly negative phrases like \"dwindling number of loyalists\",
    \"notoriety\", \"erratic and imperious behavior\", \"delusional grandeur\" et
    al.\n\nThe sad thing is, this stuff works. A lot of my friends are incredibly
    smart people, but when you ask most of them about Julian Assange, I hear comments
    like \"<i>oh, he's a bit creepy</i>\" or \"<i>he seems really narcissistic</i>\".
    People largely stopped talking about what Wikileaks revealed years ago, & now
    discussion of Assange is dominated by the usual cliches about him being arrogant,
    a rapist, etc. That's when you know the character assassination has worked: when
    even smart people have forgotten about the real point.\n\nAs Assange himself said
    to CNN: \"<i>Do you want to talk about deaths of 104,000 people or my personal
    life?</i>\". \n\nWe can't expect the mainstream media to do a great job on this.
    Let's step up and do it ourselves.\n\n"

    the students would answer immediately. But the next time I would ask the question
    - the same subject, and the same question, as far as I could tell - they couldn't
    answer it at all!…\n>\n> After a lot of investigation, I finally figured out that
    the students had memorised everything, but they didn't know what anything meant…Everything
    was entirely memorised, yet nothing had been translated into meaningful words.
    So if I asked, \"What is Brewster's Angle?\" I'm going into the computer with
    the right keywords. But if I say, \"Look at the water\", nothing happens - they
    don't have anything under \"Look at the water\"!\n>\n> \\- Richard Feynman\n\nI'm
    not a teacher by profession, but I had the chance to volunteer recently. It reminded
    me why I hated school so much.\n\nI was teaching Maths to 16-17 years olds. The
    material was so sterile and boring; it made me want to yawn. But when I do Maths
    on my own, it feels like playing, exploration!\n\nOne time, for example, we were
    finding the stationary points on a curve. \n\nIt was reduced to a recipe you had
    to remember. If you were good, you remembered the recipe & could recognize when
    you had to use it: 'OK, it's this type of question. For this type of question,
    I have to use this formula, and this formula... OK, great. Now let me put the
    numbers in. OK, got the answer. Next question.' \n\nYou remember the formulae,
    pass the exam, forget everything, but get the credentials you need to go on to
    university. That's what I hated about school - it felt like such a waste of time,
    learning stuff that I was probably going to forget.\n\nMy education taught me
    to value *getting the right answer*. (It also taught me to value prestige, prizes,
    etc.) So I worked hard at memorizing things, and anytime I wasn't sure I'd get
    the right answer the first time, I'd be scared to try, in case I failed or made
    myself look stupid.\n\nBut I later learned that to get anything of real value
    done, you've got to be prepared to do stuff badly the first time - purely because
    you'll be doing so many things that are new to you, and failing is just a natural
    part of the learning process. \n\nA book I read recently, ['How Children Fail'](http://www.amazon.com/Children-Fail-Classics-Child-Development/dp/0201484021/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1360525081&sr=8-1&keywords=how+children+fail),
    by John Holt, articulates the idiocy of this very well. \n\n> Kids in school seem
    to use a fairly consistent strategy…it is answer-centred rather than problem-centred…\n>\n>
    The problem-centred person see s a problem as a statement about a situation, from
    which something has been left out. In other words, there is in this situation
    a relationship or consequence that has not been stated and that must be found…The
    answer to any problem, school problem, is in the problem, only momentarily hidden
    from view. \n>\n> But most children in school are answer-centred rather than problem-centred.
    They see a problem as a kind of announcement that, far off in some mysterious
    Answerland, there is an answer, which they are supposed to go out and find. Some
    children begin right away to try to pry this answer out of the mind of the teacher…the
    problem is an answer-getting recipe, a set of hints or clues telling them what
    to do, like instructions for finding buried pirate treasure…\n>\n> Practically
    everything we do in school tends to make children answer-centred…right answers
    pay off. Schools are a kind of temple of worship for 'right answers'…\n\nI was
    a huge tinkerer as a teenager & taught myself to play several musical instruments.
    I used to be obsessed with Gould's rendering of [*the Goldberg Variations*](https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&cad=rja&ved=0CD0QtwIwAQ&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DN2YMSt3yfko&ei=-vYXUds6yYzTBfXCgegC&usg=AFQjCNF4myF3GTaQ7YwPz2WDRdTrvju5NQ&bvm=bv.42080656,d.d2k)
    and wanted to learn the piano, so I could play those. So I taught myself the piano
    and the whole thing was *fun* - no external expectations or answers I had to get,
    no 'doing things the right way', just listening to myself and figuring out whether
    what I was playing sounded good or not. \n\nIn the last couple of years, I've
    been going through a process of un-education: removing all the bad habits that
    school somehow implanted in me:\n\n* Being afraid of failure or embarrassment\n\n*
    Going after prizes and prestigious awards\n\n* Avoiding stuff I didn't know how
    to do\n\n* Trying to get answers before fully considering the problem\n\n* Being
    uncomfortable with *not knowing*\n\nOne of the signal qualities of children at
    play is their fearlessness. They'll experiment. Falling over is fine. \n\nOur
    system should be producing more adults with this same fearlessness, who go after
    what they really want from the start in rational, systematic ways. Right now,
    we tend to produce 'answer-centred' people who are terrified of doing things wrong.
    \n\nSome of them eventually figure things out and become happier people. But I
    know so many who've just given up. They end up becoming the middle managers in
    big corporates. \n\nWe need to find a better way to teach children, one that doesn't
    kill their innate sense of curiosity and play.   \n\n<i>Update: some good discussion

  content: ! "I'm a British citizen, and have grown up here most of my life. My parents
    are from Pakistan. \n\nEvery time I've been to the US, I've been pulled aside
    from all the other people going through passport control, and ordered into a waiting
    room. Once it was both me and my little brother, who was 14 at the time. (This
    hasn't happened to me anywhere other than the US.)\n\nAfter a long flight, I'm
    usually in a semi-comatose state, my ears buzzing slightly. I don't sleep well
    on planes, so I'm very tired. I trudge slowly along in the queues. Finally, I
    get to the gate and hand the officer my passport. \n\nSince you know what's coming,
    you try and look as 'normal' as possible: smile a bit and otherwise maintain a
    neutral expression. The usual routine, of course, is that they stamp your passport
    and hand it back, at which point you gladly reclaim your stuff and head out to
    meet whoever you're meeting. \n\nInstead, he (it's usually a he) looks at you.
    You look back evenly. He then gets out, walks over to an officer standing behind
    the booth, hands over your passport to him, mutters a few things, comes back,
    and tells you to follow the officer.\n\nThe people behind you in the queue notice,
    which is annoying, because now you feel like you've done something wrong, even
    though you haven't. Your heart sinks. You're <i>really</i> tired and just want
    to go to bed, but instead you've got the prospect of a 3 hour wait ahead of you.
    \n\nYou follow the officer. If you're feeling particularly annoyed, you ask where
    you're being taken. The reply: 'Just follow me, sir.' \n\nThe officers wherever
    I've been in the US have been pretty rude and unfriendly. \n\nHe takes you to
    a large-ish waiting room with a bunch of black seats in rows, tells you sit down,
    and hands your passport to the officers behind the desk. There are some other
    people in the waiting room, all identifiably 'foreign'. Some mother in a headscarf
    with her kid. \n\nThere's usually someone looking upset while an officer examines
    the contents of their suitcase in great detail, before taking it out and putting
    it aside, or just throwing the thing to the floor. They're gonna have to repack
    all of that. \n\nYou wait awhile, looking expectant. Presumably you've been brought
    here for a reason.\n\nIf you're lucky, you kept a book on you, so you read. Otherwise,
    you watch the people, and hope your name gets called. \n\nAn hour passes. You
    are seriously annoyed. No one has told you why you're here. Summoning up some
    courage, you stand up and walk over to the desk (the others look at you). You
    ask the officer why you're here. She orders you - loudly enough for everyone to
    hear - to sit down and they'll be with you shortly, <i>sir</i>.\n\nYou're tired
    as hell. You're also really angry. A little embarrassed, too. Part of you wants
    to argue, but it'd be pointless, so you don't. \n\nYou wait, and you wait, and
    you wait. You think about everything. You go over memories. You smile at the kid
    a few seats away playing on a Nintendo DS. You wait some more. Your ears are buzzing.
    It's indescribably monotonous and stuffy. You wish you hadn't come.\n\n3 hours
    later (meanwhile, your phone is out of battery and your aunt is waiting outside
    for you, convinced you're dead because your plane landed 4 hours ago and she's
    a worrier), someone behind the desk says your name. You go over. \n\nThey ask
    you a few questions. Sometimes they take you into a bare side room with only a
    table and two chairs, and sometimes it's just standing at the main desk. \n\n<i>Why
    are you here? What's your business here? Who are you seeing? How long have you
    known them? Where do you work? Did you go to university? What did you study? Why
    that? Have you ever been to Pakistan? Were you in the military over there? Have
    you been to the US before?</i>\n\nI've been asked all of the above. \n\nYou answer
    in a monotone, trying to sound as <i>English</i> as possible. You keep the sarcasm
    out of your voice.\n\nEventually, they stamp your passport and you are escorted
    out. \n\nWelcome to America.\n\n(<i>Originally on [Quora](http://www.quora.com/Racial-Profiling/What-does-it-feel-like-to-be-racially-profiled/answer/Nabeel-Qureshi).</i>)"

- title: why-i-run-marathons
  slug: why-i-run-marathons
  content: ! "A lot of people are mystified as to why I run marathons. So I thought
    I'd write about it. \n\n<b>It's 'endurance practice'</b>. Getting through a marathon
    requires an extraordinary mental effort <i>not to stop</i> when your entire body
    is screaming at you to stop. \n\nWhy? The body can only store about 20 miles'
    worth of glycogen (an easily accessible form of energy derived from carbs) before
    turning to other sources of fuel such as fat. So the last six miles of a marathon
    are agony. (Known as ['hitting the wall'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitting_the_wall)).
    \n\nBut once you've pushed through those last six miles, your mind internalizes
    the fact that it can do more or less what it wants, even if the body complains.
    That lesson applies to all sorts of areas. \n\n(Related: [By endurance we conquer](http://blog.samaltman.com/by-endurance-we-conquer).)\n\n<b>It's
    joyful</b>. Maybe this is just because I'm desk-bound at work all the time, but
    the sheer pleasure of *moving* outside compels me to run. I get restless if I
    haven't done it in a few days. Most of us don't experience this anymore: I only
    discovered it after a few months' running. Discovering a new, reliable source
    of joy is valuable.\n\n<b>It's a form of meditation</b>. My mind quietens down
    after running for 20-30 minutes. Our minds need quiet time just to wander, generate
    ideas, etc: running distances is one way of doing that. (Paul Graham [recommends
    taking hikes](http://www.paulgraham.com/addiction.html).) I don't take any electronic
    stuff with me when running. \n\n<b>Emotional stability.</b> You could think of
    your life as a 'portfolio' of different things: work, relationships, etc. The
    more things in your portfolio, the less impact each has on your overall 'position'.
    So maybe you had a bad week at work, but you also reached a personal best while
    running. Result: stability.\n\n<b>It's healthy</b>. Everyone knows that exercise
    is healthy. Running, in particular, makes me feel great afterwards: I'm clear-headed
    and can think quicker, I feel more energetic, I sleep better, food tastes better,
    colours are brighter, etc. \n\n<b>It's communal</b>. I train alone, but the race
    itself is a communal experience. Thousands of you wait together before the event
    starts while music & trumpets play, announcers blare into their mics, crowds cheer,
    etc. It feels exactly like what I imagine going into battle to feel like, minus
    the fear - like your heart's swelling. It sounds absurd, but is actually great
    fun.\n\nRunners tend to be pretty nice to each other, too, since the marathon
    isn't really a competitive sport except at the elite level. You're only racing
    against yourself.\n\n<b>It's an excuse to go outside</b>. Related to the 'joy'
    thing: I feel terrible if I spend too much time indoors. I refuse to run on treadmills,
    because it's boring and sterile. But being outside is awesome: there's value in
    just observing things, whether it's trees in a park or the architecture of houses
    in different parts of London. \n\n<b>It's a massive 'f you' to mortality.</b>
    I'm not going to be able to do this when I'm older and disintegrating. It seems
    worth enjoying now. \n\nYou can probably get most of these from other forms of
    exercise as well. I picked running because all I needed were some shoes to do
    it. It worked out pretty well, though. \n\nThe main thing to remember is that
    you won't like it straightaway: it takes 4-6 weeks of regular running before your
    body/mind adjust and you start enjoying it. So push through."
