  content: ! "Apparently the [All Souls exam](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Souls_College,_Oxford#Examination_Fellowships)
    is the hardest in the world. Whether that's true or not, the [questions](http://www.all-souls.ox.ac.uk/userfiles/file/EF/PastPapers/General.pdf)
    are interesting and answering them is a good mental challenge. In this series
    I intend to do that - without looking at anything external.\n\nThe first question
    is taken from the paper Philosophy I, [here](http://www.all-souls.ox.ac.uk/userfiles/file/EF/PastPapers/Philosophy.pdf).\n\nLet
    me begin by describing two <i>opposed</i> answers to this question, based on intuition.
    I will then combine these intuitions into a view which honours the right in both,
    while avoiding any confusions.\n\nSuppose, at time <i>t</i>, there is a box and
    it contains, with probability 0.5, a marble.\n\nIntuition 1: Objectively, measuring
    the state of the world at <i>t</i>, the marble is under Box 1. <i>Before</i> opening
    any boxes, I conclude that the marble lies under Box 1 with probability 0.5. <i>After</i>
    opening box one, however, I conclude that the marble lies under Box 1 with probability
    1.\n\nNothing about the world has changed except that I have observed something.
    The probability has changed because of this observation. But an objective thing
    is something about which my observations and subjective state of knowledge cannot
    possibly make any difference. <i>Therefore, there cannot be any such thing as
    an objective probability.</i>\n\nIntuition 2: At time <i>t</i>, if it is true
    that the probability of the marble being under a given box is 0.5, then if I guessed
    randomly, I would be correct one out of two times on average.\n\nThis simple observation
    gives me objective, usable knowledge about the world. Consider a game in which
    there are 100 boxes, each with 0.5 probability of containing a marble. I have
    to guess how many of these boxes actually contain a marble – call my guess N.
    I guess, then I lose £\\|(N-X)\\|. \n\nIn this game, my <i>dominant strategy</i>
    – i.e. the strategy which minimizes \\|N-X\\|, my loss – is to guess ‘50’ every
    time. This is an empirically demonstrable result – someone who disbelieves this
    is welcome to play the game and guess ‘1’ or ‘2’ instead of ‘50’ and observe the
    outcome. If an intelligent alien changed my brain such that I mistakenly believed
    that the probability was, e.g., 0.01, then that would not make the probability
    0.01. The fact that the probability is 0.5 is completely independent of whether
    or not any particular mind believes that it is 0.5. But this is the definition
    of an objective truth. <i>Therefore, probability must be objective.</i>\n\nHow
    to resolve this paradox?\n\nWe have proven, informally, that:\n\n* Probability
    is mind-independent, i.e. probabilities do not depend on someone believing in
    them to be true (objective)\n* Estimated probabilities can change based on the
    state of knowledge of the observer (subjective)\n\nObjective things are <i>mind-independent</i>.
    A rock does not depend on someones observing that rock; it exists whether or not
    someone is there to observe it. Moreover, if a rock is an igneous rock, then it
    is an igneous rock regardless, once again, of whether someone is there to observe
    it.\n\nHowever: my estimation that the rock is igneous, depends on my state of
    knowledge about the world; or, in Bayesian terms, my [prior](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prior_probability).
    The probability estimate can change as I discover new facts, e.g. that the rock
    has a glassy texture or displays layering. Moreover, the fact that I believe that
    the probability is X, is not a fact about the world, it is a fact about my mind.\n\nDoes
    that mean that anything goes? Obviously not. The probability of a fair coin landing
    heads is 0.5. Provided that I know all the facts, <i>I cannot change this probability
    by changing my beliefs</i>. If I could, then we would witness people winning the
    lottery, or poker, at will. Clearly, this is not the case.\n\nTo sum up: probabilities
    are (a) true or false, (b) regardless of what I believe about this probabilities.
    Estimated probabilities (c) depend on the prior knowledge of the mind in question.
    Moreover, (d) the fact that the probability is X is a fact about my mind.\n\n<b>Based
    on these facts, it is wrong to conclude either that probability is subjective
    <i>or</i> that probability is objective</b>. For example, traits a and b are features
    of things we call objective, but traits c and d are features of things that we
    call subjective.\n\nWe know all the facts. Telling us that it is subjective or
    objective gives us <i>no additional information</i>, nor does it lead to any differing
    expectations about reality. (Like the old question: if a tree falls in the woods,
    does it make a sound? It depends on whether your definition of sound includes
    'someone hearing it', or whether it's just 'acoustic vibrations'. That's it. There's
    no factual disagreement here, it's all at the level of <i>language</i> rather
    than <i>the world</i>.)\n\nProbability has conceptual features from both classes,
    so some composite label would be best, if a label were necessary. As it is, <b>neither
    'subjective' nor 'objective' will do</b>."

  content: ! "My favourite thing about Peter Thiel's <i>invaluable</i> lectures (via
    [BlakeMasters](http://blakemasters.tumblr.com/)), was Thiel's question: \"What
    do you believe that almost no one else believes?\" (The business version: \"What
    valuable company is no one building right now?\")\n\nWhat's elegant about this
    is that the logic for business mirrors the logic for beliefs.\n\nThe business
    logic is basically the efficient market hypothesis. Think of the set of all money-making
    ideas, and assume that you have a market full of entrepreneurs who want to make
    money. All of the <i>obvious</i> valuable ideas are grabbed and those markets
    become saturated. Only <i>non-obvious</i> ideas remain, and many of those are
    grabbed, too.\n\nThe bar of difficulty is high: most things have been taken already.
    Only the ideas that lie in unexpected directions are left, and most people don't
    take those directions, because they don't look like they could work to the average
    mind. \n\nThink of it as a treasure hunt, where all the areas of the map that
    are:\n\n1.  Obviously promising for treasure\n2.  Not dangerous \n\nare exhausted.
    The only areas that remain are the ones that either seem <i>non-promising</i>,
    or <i>dangerous</i>. The business versions of these obstacles are: \"that will
    never work, what a crazy idea\", and \"that's way too difficult, you'll never
    manage that without getting eaten\" respectively.\n\nAnd yet, <i>some opportunities
    will always exist</i>. The map is never exhausted. \n\nYou just have to be either
    fearless (to get over the danger) or unconventional (to go to the areas that seem
    unpromising).\n\nA nice illustration of the 'non-promising' argument is from Paul
    Buchheit inventing AdSense on his [blog](http://paulbuchheit.blogspot.co.uk/2009/01/communicating-with-code.html).
    It fits the pattern: people thought it was an obviously bad idea and, in any case,
    probably too hard.\n\n> The great thing about this process was that I didn't need
    to sell anyone on my ideas. I would just write the code, release the feature,
    and watch the response. Usually, everyone (including me) would end up hating whatever
    it was (especially my ideas), but we always learned something from the experience,
    and we were able to quickly move on to other ideas. \n\n> The most dramatic example
    of this process was the creation of content targeted ads (now known as \"AdSense\",
    or maybe \"AdSense for Content\"). The idea of targeting our keyword based ads
    to arbitrary content on the web had been floating around the company for a long
    time -- it was \"obvious\". However, it was also \"obviously bad\". Most people
    believed that it would require some kind of fancy artificial intelligence to understand
    the content well enough to target ads, and even if we had that, nobody would click
    on the ads. I thought they were probably right.\n\n> However, we needed a way
    for Gmail to make money, and Sanjeev Singh kept talking about using relevant ads,
    even though it was obviously a \"bad idea\". I remained skeptical, but thought
    that it might be a fun experiment, so I connected to that ads database (I assure
    you, random engineers can no longer do this!), copied out all of the ads+keywords,
    and did a little bit of sorting and filtering with some unix shell commands. I
    then hacked up the \"adult content\" classifier that Matt Cutts and I had written
    for safe-search, linked that into the Gmail prototype, and then loaded the ads
    data into the classifier. My change to the classifier (which completely broke
    its original functionality, but this was a separate code branch) changed it from
    classifying pages as \"adult\", to classifying them according to which ad was
    most relevant. The resulting ad was then displayed in a little box on our Gmail
    prototype ui. The code was rather ugly and hackish, but more importantly, it only
    took a few hours to write! \n\n> I then released the feature on our unsuspecting
    userbase of about 100 Googlers, and then went home and went to sleep. The response
    when I returned the next day was not what I would classify as \"positive\". Someone
    may have used the word \"blasphemous\". I liked the ads though -- they were amusing
    and often relevant. An email from someone looking for their lost sunglasses got
    an ad for new sunglasses. The lunch menu had an ad for balsamic vinegar.\n\nOf
    course, AdSense is now worth 28% of Google's revenue, or almost $10 billion. Some
    bad idea.\n\nFinding ideas in areas that don't seem promising seems pretty hard.
    One trick is to ask the question: will things still be that way in 100 years?
    If not, how should they change?\n\nI learned this trick from [Paul Graham](http://paulgraham.com/ambitious.html).\n\nGoogle
    may seem like it will exist forever, but are you really telling me that people
    will still be using Google for search in 100 years? Probably not. If that's the
    case, then something will displace Google - sooner or later. Why not now?\n\nI
    said at the start of this post that the business logic mirrors the idea logic.
    What about ideas?\n\nWell, think of a set of beliefs. Actually, think of the <i>set
    of all sets</i> of beliefs, i.e. a load of 'belief-packages'. What era you are
    born in, and where, determines where you land in this set. (Being born in ancient
    Greece means that I most likely have a very different set of beliefs to someone
    born in the UK today.)\n\nWe know that every era in the past had belief-sets that
    had mixed proportions of true/false factual beliefs, or right/wrong moral beliefs.
    No society thus far has had fully-true-on-average belief-sets, or fully 'right'
    belief-sets. It is improbable that our society has got there. So there must be
    some factual beliefs that we hold that are untrue, or moral beliefs that are wrong.
    \n\nIt's worth thinking about what those are. After all, at some point in the
    future some guy is going to disrupt some of our most preciously held beliefs that
    we currently consider true or right. Which ones do we think those will be?"

  content: ! "A few interesting experimental results:\n\n* People display stronger
    preferences for eating an apple over a candy bar <i>if this takes place in a week's
    time, compared to today</i>;\n* People tend to explain their own actions <i>situationally</i>,
    and others' actions by <i>dispositions</i>. <i>He</i> tripped over a rock because
    he's careless, <i>I</i> tripped over a rock because it was placed really stupidly;
    <i>she</i>'s a conservative because she's from a rich background, <i>I'm</i> a

    see the same policy as desirable if it's going to be implemented <i>tomorrow</i>,
    as opposed to the distant future;\n* People negotiate better if the outcome of
    the negotiation isn't going to take effect for several months, compared to if
    it will take effect tomorrow.\nMost people associate living in a cottage with
    peace, quiet and sunshine. But in practice, living in a cottage could also mean
    bad plumbing, mosquitos, no medical care, dampness and so on. \n\nWhen we're taking
    a decision to live in a cottage _next year_ as opposed to living in a cottage
    <i>tomorrow</i>, we are more likely to think of the peace and quiet. If it's going
    to be <i>tomorrow</i>, though, we're more likely to think about transport, weather
    and other such practicalities.\n\nThese are all examples of near-far bias, or
    , as the psychologists call it, 'construal level theory'. \n\nThe idea is that
    humans process things that are 'near' differently from things that are further
    away. The farther away an experience is in time, for example, the more abstractly
    we tend to think of it. Whereas the nearer something is in time, the more concrete
    and local our reasoning is. The same goes for 'nearness' in space.\n\nIt's a powerful
    idea. [Correspondence bias](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_attribution_error),
    for example, becomes a special case: my beliefs are 'near' (I see them in great
    detail), whereas someone else's beliefs are 'far'. I explain my beliefs by detailed
    context, argumentation and reasoning, whereas someone else's beliefs are seen
    as instances of cruder, higher-level traits such as social background, 'conservatism'
    and so on. \n\nThis heuristic can be manipulated for signalling purposes. \n\nWhy
    should smoking be 'artistic'? Why do religions sometimes mandate growing beards?
    \n\nThe ideals most major religions profess are similar, but the behaviours each
    encourage can sometimes seem arbitrary, e.g not eating with your left hand, resting
    on the 7th day, and so forth. \n\nIf the ideals you profess contradict the actions
    you actually prefer, you run into potential accusations of hypocrisy, because
    people judge by actions. For example, if you claim to be religious and a follower
    of Jesus, who professed peace, but you are actually a driving force behind a war
    that Jesus would certainly not have advocated, it seems clear that that the 'near'
    you contradicts the 'far' you. What's a hypocrite to do?\n\n<i>The ideal strategy
    for our hypocrite to follow would be to have 'near' actions that are consistent
    with, and associated with, the 'far' ideals she wishes to signal, but which do
    not substantively affect the 'near' actions that she really prefers.</i>\n\nNote
    that these behaviours are <i>consistent with</i> the ideals that these religions
    share, but are clearly not logically implied by them. Could the behaviours have
    evolved to signal those ideals? They can therefore be gamed by people who want
    to signal those ideals, but do not actually want to adopt the behavioural pattern
    that the ideals would really imply: i.e. hypocrites. \n\nIdeals are 'far', i.e.
    abstract. Actions, on the other hand, are concrete and therefore 'near'.)\n\nI've
    noticed that the really great religious leaders I've met have usually been very
    funny, happy people. Whereas the foot soldiers are, more often than not, solemn
    and not much fun. There's nothing in the scriptures to say that you <i>have</i>
    to be that way, so it's probably signalling behaviour. Which explains why the
    leaders don't have to do it - because they know the essence of their religion.\n\nThis
    would also explain why so many wannabe writers are pretentious, wear large glasses,
    and so on, whereas real writers don't necessarily display that behaviour in any
    correlated way. The wannabes need to signal their writer-status, and, moreover,
    are more likely not to really want to be writers so much as they want to be perceived
    as writers. Whereas the good writers prefer writing, as evidenced by the fact
    that we consider them good writers. \n\nSo if you want to be a good writer, leave
    the beret in the closet and just write. Anything else and you're fooling yourself."

  slug: surprisingly-undervalued-books
  content: ! 'I saw ''Moneyball'' recently. It''s about a baseball coach who takes
    on a failing team and turns them into a huge success. His method? Acquire players
    who seem terrible, but are actually good. In other words, find undervalued baseball
    players.


    This got me thinking about books. I''ve read some great books recently which I
    wouldn''t have heard of by reading ''best of'' lists or going through an A-Z of
    the classics. In almost all cases, I heard of them through bloggers or forums.
    Yet I consider these to be some of the most important books I''ve read so far.


    These books don''t look like they''ll be worth much on the surface, and turn out
    to be really great. They''re undervalued.


    I''m not necessarily talking about obscure books/authors here. I''m talking about
    the ratio of how good the book is to how good you expect it to be. These are the
    outliers, the ones that most people don''t talk about very much or haven''t heard
    of, and yet turn out to be profoundly brilliant.


    One interesting pattern these books display - with the caveat that this is a very
    small sample size - is that they''re generally in a particular niche. ''Impro'',
    for example, is disguised as a drama book but turns out to be a book about education
    philosophy, creativity, the theory of narrative and the role of status in human
    interaction; ''The Inner Game of Tennis'' looks like a tennis instruction manual
    and turns out to be a book about Zen, the ''two selves'', and other things.


    I''d love to find more of these. So if you know of any, please email me, Facebook
    me, tweet me, whatever.


    The list so far:


    1\. ''**[Impro](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Impro-Performance-Books-Improvisation-Theatre/dp/0713687010/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1350209370&amp;sr=8-1)**''
    by Keith Johnstone. Learning certain sets of concepts - like Newtonian mechanics,
    calculus, comparative advantage - changes the way you see the world. ''Impro''
    gave me at least a piece of the set of concepts for understanding human interaction
    at a conscious, theoretical level. Yet it''s a totally unpretentious book about
    improvisational drama.


    This is probably the book I''d recommend the most from this list to the average
    person.


    2\. ''**[The Inner Game of Tennis](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Inner-Game-Tennis-Timothy-Gallwey/dp/0330295136/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1350209411&amp;sr=1-1)**''
    by Timothy Gallwey. This is supposed to be a book about getting better at tennis,
    but only one chapter is devoted to the actual mechanics of tennis. Instead, it''s
    a great instruction manual on emotion, stress, Zen Buddhism, and achievement.
    Frankly, it blew my mind.


    You can get a taste it it in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50L44hEtVos)
    brilliant video with Alan Kay, but it''s only a fraction of the kind of thing
    you''ll find in this book.


    3\. ''**[The Philosophical Investigations](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Philosophical-Investigations-Ludwig-Wittgenstein/dp/1405159294/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1350209483&amp;sr=1-1)**''
    by Ludwig Wittgenstein. This is probably the book with the most ''classic'' status
    of the bunch. I find that it''s thoroughly undervalued by philosophers, though,
    who see it as an arcane and eccentric work of little value. And ordinary people
    don''t bother reading it, probably for good reason: it''s a difficult thing to
    read. However, spending the time to understand it is hugely rewarding.


    Ironically for a book ignored by most philosophers, it contains the answers to
    a lot of their questions, and the method for answering all of them.


    4\. ''**[Raise High The Roofbeams, Carpenter / Seymour: An Introduction](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Raise-High-Roof-Carpenters-Seymour/dp/0241950465/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1350209566&amp;sr=1-1)**''
    by J.D. Salinger. I was tempted to put ''Franny and Zooey'' here too, but I think
    it has enough devotion that it''s disqualified. This collection of two stories
    by Salinger, however, is much less well known. Yet I''d put this in my fiction
    top 5. I must have read Seymour: An Introduction about 20 times.


    I''ve recommended this to a few people and only one other person has liked it
    as much as I do. Most people didn''t get it. I''m not sure what conclusion to
    draw from that.


    5\. ''**[Shakespeare''s Sonnets](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Shakespeares-Sonnets-Yale-Nota-Bene/dp/0300085060/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1350209598&amp;sr=1-1)**''
    by Stephen Booth. If you don''t get poetry, read Stephen Booth. Maybe you''ve
    read some poems and really like them, but you can''t articulate exactly why beyond
    just gesturing. Booth gives a definition of why poems are good that is, I think,
    objective enough that you could develop a computer-generated index of the goodness
    of a poem out of it. Not everyone will agree with it, but I''ve found it works
    really well. Wikipedia has a good list of some of his stuff online [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Booth_(academic)).


    6\. ''**[Principles](http://www.bwater.com/Uploads/FileManager/Principles/Bridgewater-Associates-Ray-Dalio-Principles.pdf)''&nbsp;**(pdf)
    by Ray Dalio. Dalio''s a hedge fund manager - the most successful one in the world.
    His firm, Bridgewater, is known for being radically transparent: every meeting
    is recorded and recordings are available to anyone (so I could access the recordings
    of a meeting between two managers discussing my feedback, for example).


    This is good reading if you''re in business and want to understand what makes
    a good company culture, and how to solve problems. It''s also good reading in
    general, because Dalio has a relentlessly rational, critical take on things and
    it''s good for people to see that kind of mind at work. He talks a lot about how
    to achieve things as well, which is always useful. His advice here is better than
    any self-help book.&nbsp;


    7\. ''**[Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain](http://www.amazon.co.uk/New-Drawing-Right-Side-Brain/dp/0007116454
    "Drawing")**'' by Betty Edwards. Again, this blew my mind. I sucked at drawing
    as a teenager, and this book taught me how to do it. She specializes in teaching
    people to draw competently over short periods of time using what I can only describe
    as extremely clever hacks.&nbsp;


    In the process, the book also taught me that (a) with hard work and the right
    methods, you can learn most things, and your barriers are probably mental; (b)
    &lsquo;bad&rsquo; drawers don&rsquo;t look at the thing itself and draw its shape,
    they translate reality into abstract concepts first and then draw what that concept
    visually looks like, and a great way to prove this (and hack the process) is to
    copy a drawing upside down; (c) seeing things as they really are is harder than
    you think.&nbsp;


    8\. **[Ray Carney](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Carney)**: not naming a particular
    book here. Like the other books here, his writings seem to be just about films,
    but if you read them deeply enough they turn out to be a recipe for more than
    that - in this case, how to be a good, empathetic human being. He got me into
    John Cassavetes, which alone makes him worth the read. His writings on film are
    amazing. You can find a bunch of them via Wikipedia.&nbsp;


    I actually don''t expect most people to like the books on this list - that''s
    just a sober prediction. To me, though, that''s a good sign. If everything I liked
    was what everybody *would* like, then I''d have something to worry about.&nbsp;'
