<i>Sebastian Arrurruz: 1868 - 1922</i>

<h3>I</h3>  

Ten years without you. For so it happens.  
Days make their steady progress, a routine  
That is merciful and attracts nobody.  

Already, like a disciplined scholar,  
I piece fragments together, past conjecture  
Establishing true sequences of pain;  

For so it is proper to find value  
In a bleak skill, as in the thing restored:  
The long-lost words of choice and valediction.
<br />
<br />

<h3>COPLAS</h3>  

<p style='margin-left:200px'>i</p>  
'One cannot lose what one has not possessed.'  
So much for that abrasive gem.   
I can lose what I want. I want you.   

<p style='margin-left:200px'>ii</p>  
Oh my dear one, I shall grieve for you  
For the rest of my life with slightly  
Varying cadence, oh my dear one.  

<p style='margin-left:200px'>iii</p>  
Half-mocking the half-truth, I note  
'The wild brevity of sensual love'.  
I am shaken, even by that.  

<p style='margin-left:200px'>iv</p> 
It is to him I write, it is to her  
I speak in contained silence. Will they be touched  
By the unfamiliar passion between them?  
<br />

<h3>3</h3>  

What other men do with other women  
Is for me neither orgy nor sacrament  
Nor a language of foreign candour  

But is mere occasion or chance distance  
Out of which you might move and speak my name  
As I speak yours, bargaining with sleep's  

Miscellaneous gods for as much  
As I can have: an alien landscape,  
The dream where you are always to be found.   
<br />

<h3>4</h3>  

A workable fancy. Old petulant  
Sorrow comes back to us, metamorphosed  
And semi-precious. Fortuitous amber.   
As though this recompensed our deprivation.   
See how each fragment kindles as we turn it,  
At the end, into the light of appraisal.   
<br />

<h3>5</h3>  

Love, oh my love, it will come  
Sure enough. A storm  
Broods over the dry earth all day.   
At night the shutters throb in its downpour.   

The metaphor holds; is a snug house.   
You are outside, lost somewhere. I find myself  
Devouring verses of stranger passion  
And exile. The exact words  

Are fed into my blank hunger for you.  
<br />

<h3>POSTURES</h3>  

I imagine, as I imagine us  
Each time more stylized more lovingly  
Detailed, that I am not myself  
But someone I might have been: sexless,  
Indulgent about art, relishing  
Let us say the well-schooled   
Postures of St Anthony or St Jerome,  
Those peaceful hermaphrodite dreams  
Through which the excess of memory  
Pursues its own abstinence.  
<br />

<h3>FROM THE LATIN</h3>  

There would have been things to say, quietness  
That could feed on our lust, refreshed  
Trivia, the occurrences of the day;  
And at night my tongue in your furrow.   

Without you I am mocked my courtesies   
And chat, where satisfied women push  
Dutifully toward some unneeded guest  
Desirable features of conversation.  
<br />

<h3>A LETTER FROM ARMENIA</h3>  

So, remotely, in your part of the world:  
the ripe glandular blooms, and cypresses  
shivering with heat (which we have borne  
also, in our proper ways) I turn my mind  
towards delicate pillage, the provenance  
of shards glazed and unglazed, the three  
kinds of surviving grain. I hesitate amid  
circumstantial disasters. I gaze at the  
<span style='margin-left:100px'>authentic dead.</span>   
<br />

<h3>A SONG FROM ARMENIA</h3>  

Roughly-silvered leaves that are the snow  
On Ararat seen through those leaves.   
The sun lays down a foliage of shade.   

A drinking-fountain pulses its head  
Two or three inches from the troughed stone  
An old woman sucks there, gripping the rim.   

Why do I have to relive, even now,  
Your mouth, and your hand running over me  
Deft as a lizard, like a sinew of water?  
<br />

<h3>TO HIS WIFE</h3>  

You ventured occasionally -  
As though this were another's house -  
Not intimate but an acquaintance  
Flaunting her modest claim; like one  
Idly commiserated by new-mated  
Lovers rampant in proper delight  
When all their guests have gone.   
<br />

<h3>II</h3>  

Scarcely speaking: it becomes as a  
Coolness between neighbours. Often  
There is this orgy of sleep. I wake  
To caress propriety with odd words  
And enjoy abstinence in a vocation  
Of now-almost-meaningless despair.  
<br />
