A few interesting experimental results:

* People display stronger preferences for eating an apple over a candy bar <i>if this takes place in a week's time, compared to today</i>;
* People tend to explain their own actions <i>situationally</i>, and others' actions by <i>dispositions</i>. <i>He</i> tripped over a rock because he's careless, <i>I</i> tripped over a rock because it was placed really stupidly; <i>she</i>'s a conservative because she's from a rich background, <i>I'm</i> a liberal because of arguments xyz - and so on)
* Employees are less likely to see the same policy as desirable if it's going to be implemented <i>tomorrow</i>, as opposed to the distant future;
* People negotiate better if the outcome of the negotiation isn't going to take effect for several months, compared to if it will take effect tomorrow.
Most people associate living in a cottage with peace, quiet and sunshine. But in practice, living in a cottage could also mean bad plumbing, mosquitos, no medical care, dampness and so on. 

When we're taking a decision to live in a cottage _next year_ as opposed to living in a cottage <i>tomorrow</i>, we are more likely to think of the peace and quiet. If it's going to be <i>tomorrow</i>, though, we're more likely to think about transport, weather and other such practicalities.

These are all examples of near-far bias, or , as the psychologists call it, 'construal level theory'. 

The idea is that humans process things that are 'near' differently from things that are further away. The farther away an experience is in time, for example, the more abstractly we tend to think of it. Whereas the nearer something is in time, the more concrete and local our reasoning is. The same goes for 'nearness' in space.

It's a powerful idea. [Correspondence bias](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_attribution_error), for example, becomes a special case: my beliefs are 'near' (I see them in great detail), whereas someone else's beliefs are 'far'. I explain my beliefs by detailed context, argumentation and reasoning, whereas someone else's beliefs are seen as instances of cruder, higher-level traits such as social background, 'conservatism' and so on. 

This heuristic can be manipulated for signalling purposes. 

Why should smoking be 'artistic'? Why do religions sometimes mandate growing beards? 

The ideals most major religions profess are similar, but the behaviours each encourage can sometimes seem arbitrary, e.g not eating with your left hand, resting on the 7th day, and so forth. 

If the ideals you profess contradict the actions you actually prefer, you run into potential accusations of hypocrisy, because people judge by actions. For example, if you claim to be religious and a follower of Jesus, who professed peace, but you are actually a driving force behind a war that Jesus would certainly not have advocated, it seems clear that that the 'near' you contradicts the 'far' you. What's a hypocrite to do?

<i>The ideal strategy for our hypocrite to follow would be to have 'near' actions that are consistent with, and associated with, the 'far' ideals she wishes to signal, but which do not substantively affect the 'near' actions that she really prefers.</i>

Note that these behaviours are <i>consistent with</i> the ideals that these religions share, but are clearly not logically implied by them. Could the behaviours have evolved to signal those ideals? They can therefore be gamed by people who want to signal those ideals, but do not actually want to adopt the behavioural pattern that the ideals would really imply: i.e. hypocrites. 

Ideals are 'far', i.e. abstract. Actions, on the other hand, are concrete and therefore 'near'.)

I've noticed that the really great religious leaders I've met have usually been very funny, happy people. Whereas the foot soldiers are, more often than not, solemn and not much fun. There's nothing in the scriptures to say that you <i>have</i> to be that way, so it's probably signalling behaviour. Which explains why the leaders don't have to do it - because they know the essence of their religion.

This would also explain why so many wannabe writers are pretentious, wear large glasses, and so on, whereas real writers don't necessarily display that behaviour in any correlated way. The wannabes need to signal their writer-status, and, moreover, are more likely not to really want to be writers so much as they want to be perceived as writers. Whereas the good writers prefer writing, as evidenced by the fact that we consider them good writers. 

So if you want to be a good writer, leave the beret in the closet and just write. Anything else and you're fooling yourself.
