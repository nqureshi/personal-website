I became a vegetarian about four months ago. I'm ashamed it took me that long, but I was raised eating meat, and barely know any vegetarians, and sometimes you avoid thinking about unpleasant stuff unless you really have to. 

The thought process below is what led me to it. It's not analytically/philosophically rigorous and I haven't dealt with all objections, but that's been done extremely well [elsewhere](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Liberation_(book)). I just thought it'd be interesting to recreate that train of thought.

A lot of people in England own dogs. It's safe to say that if I walked up to any of their dogs and shot them dead, the owners would be upset. 

Why? 

It goes beyond the mere fact they owned the dog - that would imply that they weren't upset that the dog was shot, only that someone other than them shot the dog. 

No - they'd be upset because I killed the dog! The dog wanted to live, and I killed it.

Those people would be <i>even more upset</i> if I tortured the dog before killing it. 

Now. There's nothing special about dogs. Sure, they're cute, and smart, but it's not like the rule is 'don't kill/torture cute things'. The rule is 'don't kill/torture things that don't want to be killed/tortured'.

So it seems like:

- Causing an animal pain is bad, to some degree
- Killing an animal is bad, to some degree

But perhaps this is just specific to dogs or cats? No, I think the same goes for sheep, and indeed for any animal that we think is sentient. Most people, if they lived with a sheep, took care of it, took it for walks, and so on, would be upset if some stranger killed the sheep.

You can see where this is going. 

The obvious thing a meat-eater would have to argue to justify the killing of animals is that although there is some badness in killing an animal, it's outweighed by the good consequences that result. 

In other words, what I have for dinner is more important than that animal's life. 

That seems ludicrous. What if, instead of a chicken, it were an infant baby? Let's say it was given up for adoption, so nobody cares about it, and let's also say that it's heavily disabled & will never have an IQ greater than that of a chicken. In that case, the badness of its dying can't be much greater than the badness of an animal dying - why would it be bad to kill it and eat it, too?

Eating meat seems to rely on some important distinction between humans and animals, such that eating animals is OK and eating humans is not. But what is that distinction? It can't be intelligence, because otherwise eating infant babies would be OK. 

We care about things because they are sentient. Being partial to your own species <i>because it's your own species</i> isn't a valid argument, any more than being partial to your own race, sexual orientation, gender etc. 

There just doesn't seem to be a good reason to continue killing animals and eating them, let alone at the kind of mass scale that we are doing. I think most people just do it because they were raised to think that eating meat is OK. Eating meat is unnecessary, and eating dead animals to satisfy your cravings seems like a selfish thing to do. So if you can't think of a good reason to continue doing it (if you've been paying attention, 'I enjoy it' doesn't count), can I suggest you try stopping? It's not actually as hard as you think.

- A great exploration using the medium of short fiction is done by JM Coetzee in his Tanner Lecture ['The Lives of Animals'](http://tannerlectures.utah.edu/_documents/a-to-z/c/Coetzee99.pdf).
