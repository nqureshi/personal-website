David Brooks, [writing for the NYT](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/11/opinion/brooks-the-solitary-leaker.html?ref=davidbrooks), informs us that: 

><i>he could not successfully 
work his way through the institution of high school</i> 

and that: 

>he has not 
been a regular presence around his motherâ€™s house for years.

Jeffrey 
Toobin, of the New Yorker, [writes that](http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/comment/2013/06/edward-snowden-nsa-leaker-is-no-hero.html) Snowden is: 

>a grandiose 
narcissist who deserves to be in prison.

In a really [marvelous piece](http://www.politico.com/story/2013/06/10-things-to-know-about-edward-snowden-92491.html?hp=r2) called '10 Things to Know About Edward Snowden', Politico decided that the most important thing you need know is that "<i>He doesn't have a high school diploma</i>". No. 3 is "<i>He wasn't a friendly neighbour</i>".

These smears would be laughable, if they weren't sad. When people have nothing intelligent to say, they resort to name-calling and ad 
hominem attacks. Snowden's relationship with his mother has nothing to do with, well, anything.

This isn't new. Whenever revelations like these appear, the media launches a coordinated effort to smear the character of the revealer. 
 
Back in the 70s, a guy named Daniel Ellsberg leaked the Pentagon Papers, which 
showed that the government had lied about Vietnam & dragged the US into a war 
that it knew:

- It couldn't win

- Would kill many more people than 
they said it would

After the leak, the government went into full attack mode. They even [broke into the office of Ellsberg's psychiatrist](http://www.historycommons.org/timeline.jsp?nixon_and_watergate_tmln_pentagon_papers=nixon_and_watergate_tmln_ellsberg_break_in&timeline=nixon_and_watergate_tmln). They investigated dozens of his family, friends, & colleagues, to find anything damaging, that could distract from what he was saying. 

Another whistleblower, Julian Assange, received even more brutal treatment. Here's [another hit piece on him](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/24/world/24assange.html?hp), again run by the NYT, filled with subtly negative phrases like "dwindling number of loyalists", "notoriety", "erratic and imperious behavior", "delusional grandeur" et al.

The sad thing is, this stuff works. A lot of my friends are incredibly smart people, but when you ask most of them about Julian Assange, I hear comments like "<i>oh, he's a bit creepy</i>" or "<i>he seems really narcissistic</i>". People largely stopped talking about what Wikileaks revealed years ago, & now discussion of Assange is dominated by the usual cliches about him being arrogant, a rapist, etc. That's when you know the character assassination has worked: when even smart people have forgotten about the real point.

As Assange himself said to CNN: "<i>Do you want to talk about deaths of 104,000 people or my personal life?</i>". 

We can't expect the mainstream media to do a great job on this. Let's step up and do it ourselves.
